**Name**: WaterBlock

**Description**: WaterBlock is a productivity and wellness app designed to encourage hydration by linking it directly to screen time. If users don’t drink enough water, their screen time will be restricted—motivating healthier habits through accountability. The app blends wellness goals with digital well-being, using screen usage as a motivator to stay hydrated throughout the day.

**How did you build this**: I built WaterBlock using SwiftUI. I started by following various tutorials and guides online to get a solid grasp of SwiftUI. Once I felt confident, I began building my own version of the app from scratch, incorporating features that made sense for the problem I wanted to solve. I got inspiration from the app touch grass
